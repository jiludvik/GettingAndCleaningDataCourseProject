## Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project: Tidying Up UCI HAR Data Set

### Objectives
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

### Uploaded Files
The following files have been uploaded to Github repo:

| **File name**             | **Description**                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| README.md                 | This file                                                                                                     |
| run\_analysis.R           | Script to produce the output data file with tidy data                                                         |
| CodeBook.md               | Code book describing variables in the output data file, summaries, units and other data design considerations |

A sample of the outputw file with tidy data (run\_analysis\_output.txt) has been uploaded Directly to coursera.

| A code book that ... indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information. | See Variable Descriptions, Units of Measure and Data Design Considerations section in CodeBook.md in the repo                    |
| The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.                                                                | This file                                                                       |
| The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.                                                        | No specific information submitted                                               |

**Functional Requirements**

Information supporting the assessment of how the submitted artefacts address functional requirements identified in the project brief, see:

* Comments embedded in the run_analysis.R - headlines are used to signpost parts of the scripts addressing the identified requirements;
* Data Design Considerations section in MarkDown.md;
* Output file run_analysis_output.txt generated by the script.
